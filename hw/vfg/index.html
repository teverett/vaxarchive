<p>There exists a well known file, <a href="../field-gu.txt">the Field Guide</a>,
which lists all PDP and VAX DEC boards by number and description.
This page will grow to be the visual version of this list. It shows pictures of
a lot of boards, and their number and function. This makes it easy
to identify boards with unreadable of missing module numbers.</p>
<p>There will be a question and answer routine on this page, which
will lead you to a picture of a board based on its description.</p>
<p>If you own boards that are not on this page, I would appreciate
it very much if you could send me an image of them. 
(You can download <a href="vfglist.txt">a list</a> of the pictures I already have.)
If it is a dual or quad width board, you do not need
a digital camera to make this picture, you can just lay it face down
on a flat bed scanner. (This is how all the pictures on this page
were made.) Please mail any pictures to <a href="mailto:pb0aia@iae.nl">pb0aia@iae.nl</a>. Thanks
in advance!</p>
