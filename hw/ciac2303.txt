        The Console Password Feature for DEC Workstations


Overview
--------


Introduction

Newer VAXstations and all DECstations offer a “hardware” password feature 
that, when enabled, restricts unauthorized access to your system console 
terminal when turned on or restarted.  VAXstation 3100s shipped after July, 
1989 offer this feature.  A description of this feature should be part of the 
Hardware User Guide for your workstation; however, some of the early systems 
did not document this security enhancement.  This document is based on the 
author’s investigation as well as information provided by the Digital 
Equipment Corporation.


Notation used in this document

Due to the different commands and syntax, VAXstations and DECstations will be 
described in two seperate sections within this document.  In the VAXstation 
section of this document, uppercase commands are used only to improve 
readability; lowercase commands are acceptable.  Console input may be in 
uppercase or lowercase (VAXstations are not case sensitive, but DECstations 
are).  Commands may be abbreviated to the minimum set of unique letters.  
Commands are not acted upon until the Return key is pressed, thus allowing 
corrections to be made with the <’ > (delete key) or < Control-U > (hold down 
the control key while pressing the letter U).


Notation   Meaning
>>> or >>  Console or chevron prompt.  VAXstations use the three chevron 
           prompt (>>>) and DECstations use the two chevron prompt (>>).
R>         A DECstation console that has its password set will use R> for 
           its prompt, indicating it is in restricted mode.
<  >       Angle brackets enclose items which show the range of digits or 
           name (possibly an abbreviation) of the data to be supplied.
[  ]       Square brackets surround optional items.
{  }       Curly brackets (braces) indicate you must select only one of the 
           enclosed optional items.
|          The vertical bar character separates optional items and may be 
           read as a logical “or.”
Control-C  Aborts an operation in progress.
Control-Q  Resumes output to the screen.
Control-S  Suspends output to the screen.
Control-U  Is the line erase key sequence.
’          Character delete key.


Warnings

+  When a DEC workstation is first shipped, its console system operates in 
privileged command mode.  If you do nothing to change from privileged mode, 
there will be no console command restrictions.  Anyone with physical console 
access can activate any console command, the most vulnerable being interactive 
booting.  When you set and enable the console password, you can restrict the 
available console commands to:

(1)  booting without parameters from the default device,

(2)  a command used to enable privileged command mode and,

(3)  other commands that do not provide information or control to 
     unauthorized personnel.
 
+  If you have set a password and then forget what it is, you must have a DEC 
Field Service Engineer open up your system to re-enable privileged command 
mode.


VAXstations
-----------


Selecting and entering the VAXstation console password

Step  Command/Action
1     Select a password:

      The password must be a hexadecimal string of characters (0 through 9 and 
      A through F) with a length of exactly sixteen characters.  Examples of 
      valid passwords are:

        1ACED33BD23AF301
        DAC324EABEA222EA
        111111111AACCDEE

      Examples of invalid passwords are:

        FACE              (not 16 characters long)
        442ED2FFAC213SE2  (illegal hex character, S)

+  If the password is the wrong length, contains a non-hex character, or does 
not match (old password to old password or new password to new password), the 
SET PSWD command fails and the following error message displays:  ?31 ILL PSWD

The system does not prevent password reuse, but it is good security practice 
to select a previously unused one.

2     Enter the password:

      Use the privileged SET PSWD command to enter a new password into the 
      console system:

        >>> SET PSWD

3     Validate your authority to change the old password:

      After you type the above command, the console prompts you for the old 
      password:

        3100 series        4000 series
        0 >>>        or    PSWD0 >>>

      Enter the old password and press < Return >.  If there is no old 
      password, the console proceeds to prompt for a new password:

        1 >>>        or    PSWD1 >>>

      The console does not echo (display) any password as you enter it.

4     Confirm the correct entry of the new password:

      If the password character string entered in step 3 is legal, the console 
      prompts you to enter the new password a second time, to verify correct 
      entry:

        2 >>>        or    PSWD2 >>>

      Re-enter the new password and press < Return >.  If the confirming 
      password exactly matches the new password, the new password is accepted.


Enabling and disabling the password

After selecting and entering a password, described in the previous section, 
use the privileged command SET PSE to enable (activate) or disable 
(deactivate) the password.  Entering and enabling are separate actions, i.e., 
entering a password will not automatically enable (or disable) that password.  
If you do not use one of the following commands, the password state will 
remain as it was before the first or a new password was entered.

Action  Command
Enable  >>> SET PSE 1

        +  If you have not set a password (see step 2), the following error 
        message is displayed:  ?33 NO PSWD DEF

Disable >>> SET PSE 0

+  If you enter something other than “1” or “0”, the following error message 
is displayed:  ?24 INV DGT


Placing the VAXstation in privileged mode

Use the LOGIN  command to place a VAXstation in privileged mode.  This makes 
all console commands accessible.  The form of the command is

>>> LOGIN

+  If a password is not enabled, the error message returned is:  
        ?32 PSWD NOTEN

If a password is enabled, the console prompts for password entry:

        3100 series         4000 series
        ? >>>         or    PSWD0 >>>

If the correct password is entered, the VAXstation is placed in privileged 
mode.  You then have access to all commands until issuing a command that exits 
console privileged mode (see the section “Exiting Privileged Mode,” below).

+  If an incorrect password is entered, the error message returned is:  
        ?23 ILL CMD


Learning the status of the password

To check on the status of the password feature, use the command:

>>> SHOW PSE

If a “1” or “PSE = 00000001” is displayed, the password is enabled.  If a “0” 
or “PSE = 00000000” is displayed, the password is disabled.

+  If the console is already in unprivileged mode, entering this command will 
result in the error message, ?23 ILL CMD, indicating that the password is 
enabled.


Exiting privileged mode

The following console commands, executed while the console is in privileged 
mode, cause an exit from privileged mode before any other operations are begun 
(also see asterisked commands in the Console Commands table on the next page):

>>> BOOT (with any supplied parameters)
>>> CONTINUE
>>> HALT
>>> START

Once privileged mode is exited, you must use the LOGIN command and correctly 
enter the console password to regain privileged mode.

DECstations
-----------


Setting the DECstation console password

If you have multiple monitors connected to your workstation, the monitor 
connected to the option slot with the lowest number is the system console.  
This monitor displays all system information.  The following commands are for 
the DECstation 5000 model 200:

Step  Command/Action
1     Select a password:

      The password must be an ASCII string of characters with a minimum length 
      of six characters.  The system does not prevent password reuse, but it 
      is good security practice to select a previously unused one.

2     Enter the password:

      Use the privileged command < passwd -s > to enter a new password into 
      the console system:

        >> passwd -s

      If the console password is already set and the console is in restricted 
      mode, you must use the passwd command without arguments to activate 
      privileged command mode.  The passwd command then prompts with the 
      prompt “PWD: ” 

The console does not echo (display) any password as you enter it.

3     Confirm the correct entry of the new password:

      Enter the new password and press Return.  If the password character 
      string is legal, the console prompts you to re-enter the new password, 
      in order to verify that it was correctly entered:

        PWD: 
        PWD: 

      Re-enter the new password and press Return.  If the second 
      (verification) password exactly matches the first (new) password, the 
      new password is accepted.


Enabling and disabling the password

Action   Command/Method
Enable   The password takes effect after the system is reset (by pushing the 
         reset button on the back of the system unit or by powering up).  The 
         console prompt becomes R.
Disable  The privileged command passwd -c clears the existing password.  When 
         the console password is cleared, console access is unrestricted and 
         the console prompt becomes >> .


DECstation console commands

The following commands are for the DECstation 5000 model 200 computers.  Use 
the help command to find commands available on your particular make and model.

Unprivileged commands
  R> passwd
  R> boot

Privileged commands
  >> ? [command name]	“Help command”
  >> boot [[-z #] [-n] #/path [arguments...]]
  >> cat #/scriptname
  >> cnfg [#]
  >> d [-bhw] [-S #] RANGE value
  >> e [-bhwcdoux] [-S #] RANGE
  >> erl [-c]
  >> go [address]
  >> init [[#] -m] [arguments...]
  >> ls [#]
  >> passwd [-c] [-s]
  >> printenv [EnvironmentVariableName]
  >> restart
  >> script name
  >> setenv EnvironmentVariableName  value
  >> sh [-belvS] [#/scriptname] [arguments...]
  >> t [-l] #/testname [arguments...]
  >> unsetenv EnvironmentVariableName
  

Conclusion
----------

We are living in an age where our society relies more and more on computers 
and computerized information.  The insider threat is an ever-present danger.  
Using the console password feature can help defend your computer system, its 
programs, and its data from attack.
