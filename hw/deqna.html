<h1>The DEQNA/DELQA switches</h1>

<p>You only have three jumpers on a DEQNA.
<pre>
					In		Out
W1	I/O Page Address		17774440	17774460
W2	BDMR Holdoff Timer		No Delay	5 uS Delay
W3	Sanity Timer at Initialization	Disabled	Enabled
</pre>

<p>On the DELQA there are 5 switches.

<p>As shipped, all 5 DIP switches are closed.  This means that the board
is at CSR 17774440 (first interface), operating in normal mode, with
triggered MOP remote boot disabled.

<p>Switch 1 controls the CSR: closed is first interface, open is second
interface, at CSR 17774460.

<p>Switch 2 is reserved.

<p>Switch 3 controls the emulation: closed is normal (DELQA) mode, open
is DEQNA-lock mode.

<p>Switch 4 controls triggered MOP remote boot in normal mode, automatic
sanity timer start in DEQNA-lock mode.  In both cases, the facility in
question is disabled when switch 4 is closed, enabled when it is open.

<p>Switch 5 is reserved.

<h1>Pinouts</h1>
<p>Here's a pinout for a DELQA.

<p>DELQA:

IDC connector, 12 pin by 2 pin:
<pre>
(NC) (PUR) (DK BRN) (NC)  (BLU) (SHIELD) (ORG) (NC)  (WHI) (BLK) (PLUGGED) (NC)
(NC) (BRN) (NC)     (GRN) (NC)  (YEL)    (NC)  (GRY) (NC)  (NC) (RED)      (NC)
</pre>
<p>The RED lead goes to a 1.5 amp, 25 V, slow blow fuse, that then goes to
the DB15 connector.

<p>DB15 connector:
<pre>
PIN	COLOUR
1	NC
2	BLU
3	ORG
4	SHIELD
5	WHI
6	BLK
7	DK BRN
8	NC
9	GRN
10	YEL
11	NC
12	GRY
13	RED (FROM FUSE)
14	NC
15	BRN
</pre>
<p>("NC" means "not connected")

<h1>Reading the ethernet address</h1>
<p>The DEQNA is usually at 17774440 octal.  You can read the ethernet address
here.  If yours is there, do the following:  I'll give you an example from one
of mine.  My MAC address is 08002B029707 (0800 indicates DEC MFR)

<pre>
FRESH INIT

&gt;&gt;&gt; e/p 20001920
    p  20001920  FF00FF08
&gt;&gt;&gt; e
    p  20001924  FF02FF2B
&gt;&gt;&gt; e
    p  20001928  FF07FF97
</pre>
<p>Ignore the FF's

<p>Read the complete bytes from right to left staring at 1920:
<pre>
FF00FF08 becomes  0800
FF02FF2B becomes  2B02
FF07FF97 becomes  9707
</pre>
<p>There you have the hardware address encoded in PROM!1


<p>To convert a device from octal (PDP qbus) to HEX MVII Qbus)  do the following:

<p>subtract 17760000<br>
convert to hex<br>
ad 2000000 hex.

<p>The standard alternate address is 17774460.  ==&gt;   14460   ==&gt; 0x1930  ==&gt; 20001930
