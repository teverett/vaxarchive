<H2>6.2 <A NAME="ss62"></A> What <b>are</b> those boards in my VAX?</H2>

A: Good question and somewhat of a nightmare if you didn't get any 
documentation with your system. The primary source of information about 
modules/boards is <a href="http://www.neurotica.com/dec-info/index.html">Dave 
McGuire's "DEC Module Database Search"</a>.<p>

Subject: Cabling fun

Here is an interesting bit of info that might help somebody
else sometime:

The VAX -> (monitor | keyboard | mouse) cable (what is this thing
called?) has one interesting nip.

If you have a *color* cable and a *mono* framebuffer, then the
mono+sync signal will come out of the *red* output, not the
green as you might expect (well, sync on green, right?).

This had me stumped for a while.

Hello Andre

Looking to upgrade , eh ? The machine I have at home is a VAX 6220. 2 
cpu's , 96 MB of RAM. Used to need three phase power , as you 
correctly observe.

The power system architecture of the VAX is arranged so that each 
power regulator needs a DC supply of 300V. There are various ways of 
obtaining this. They use a single phase bridge on the smaller 
machines (just like a PC PSU) , off 220V this gives about 311V. (220 
* sqrt (2)) . However , on the larger machines , it gets a little 
more involved. On the 6000 series they use a 3-phase controlled 
bridge , so they can actually regulate the 300V line. It's laid out 
like this (here goes nothing) :

              
              
            ____________________    +300V
            |    |    |
            -__  -__  -__  thyristors
            ^    ^    ^
            |    |    |
  L1  ------*    |    |
  L2  -----------*    |
  L3  ----------------*
            |    |    |
            -    -    -    diodes
            ^    ^    ^
            |    |    |
            --------------------- Return


 The three-phase controlled bridge ( as you can see ) uses the Phase 
to Phase voltage ( NOT the phase to neutral voltage ). With a 3-phase 
220V supply thats about 380V AC. Multiply that by sqrt(2) and you 
have about 520V DC . KABOOM ! However , in america , on a 115V 3-
phase system , phase to phase is 208V , multiply by sqrt(2) and you 
get about 300V DC. All 6000 series machines for 380V therefore came 
equipped with a 3-phase xformer which takes the 380 V phase/phase to 
208V phase/phase. Which of course is very close to our neutral/phase 
, which is 220V. The way to do it , then , is to bypass the xformer, 
connect L1 in the drawing to LIVE , say , and connect L2 to NEUTRAL , 
and leave L3 open. The circuit then works just like a single phase 
controlled bridge rectifier , and works very well , giving about 305 
V on the DC power bus.

Total current is ( I'm guesstimating now) propably about 4A , 
measured on the AC side , around 0.8-1.0 KVA.

I you get a 6000 (or similar) machine let me know. I have worked out 
a very elegant way to do the above mod which entails no soldering , 
no disconnecting of joints etc , and can be put back to factory 
standard in about 30 secs.

Good luck

And just to make sure you don't do a big mistake: *Never* do this
with a VAX86x0.

They really *do* need the 3-phase. The large fans are 3-phase motors,
so unless you have all three phases, your fans ain't going to run.
And the 86x0 is made with ECL, so you can guess what will happen
pretty fast.

For the same reason, never connect an 86x0 with the phases backwards,
or you'll get your fans running backwards, which will lead to the
same result (which I'm sure someone from LUDD can tell... ;-)

Well, my terminal's locked up, and I ain't got any Mail,
        And I can't recall the last time that my program didn't fail;
I've got stacks in my structs, I've got arrays in my queues,
        I've got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

If you think that it's nice that you get what you C,
        Then go : illogical statement with your whole family,
'Cause the Supreme Court ain't the only place with : Bus error views.
        I've got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

On a PDP-11, life should be a breeze,
        But with VAXen in the house even magnetic tapes would freeze.
Now you might think that unlike VAXen I'd know who I abuse,
        I've got the : Segmentation violation -- Core dumped blues.

BABY(1)                  USER COMMANDS                    BABY(1)

NAME
     BABY - create new process from two parent processes

SYNOPSIS

     BABY [ -sex ] [ -name ]

DESCRIPTION

     BABY is initiated when one parent process polls another server
process through a socket connection (BSD) or through pipes in the
System V implementation. BABY runs at a low priority for approximately
40 weeks then terminates with heavy system load. Most systems require
constant monitoring when BABY reaches its final stages of execution.

        Older implementations of BABY required that the initiating
process not be present at the time of completion. In these versions
the initiating process is awakened and notified of the results upon
completion. Modern versions allow both parent processes to be active
during the final stages of BABY.


OPTIONS

        -sex
          option indicating type of process created.

        -name
          process identification to be attached to the new process.

RESULT
     Successful execution of the BABY(1) results in new process
     being created and named. Parent processes then typically
     broadcast messages to all other processes informing them of their
     new status in the system.


BUGS
     The SLEEP command may not work on either parent processes for some
     time afterward, as new BABY processes constantly send interrupts
     which must be handled by one or more parent.

     BABY processes upon being created may frequently dump
     in /tmp requiring /tmp to be cleaned out frequently by one
     of the parent processes.

          is a list of default partners which will be used if
          none are specified in the command line.  If any are
          specified, the values in LOVERS is ignored.
