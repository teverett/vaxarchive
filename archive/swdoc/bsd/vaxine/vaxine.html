Vaxine spent the first ten years of her life running the accounting system 
for a company here in Bergen, Norway. Back then she was running VAX/VMS 
and she was part of a VAXcluster.<p>

Today she is of course running NetBSD/vax and very happy that she hasn't 
been retired (or worse, she doesn't even want to think about that!)<p>

Other stuff she is running includes the Apache Web server, Perl5, the bash 
shell, the xntpd network time sync daemon and more.<p>

She would like some more memory as she has only got 9 MB. On the other hand 
she has got plenty of disk (1.2 GB Seagate Wren VII SCSI on an MSCP-SCSI 
controller), serial lines (2 x DHV11) and of course a TK50 tape drive.<p>
