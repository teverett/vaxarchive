<p>
The VS2000 is a small and 
somewhat slow "VAX in a lunch box". It is great for the beginner to
experiment with, not as noisy and not as big as other VAX systems. It
will run VMS, Ultrix and NetBSD, and it is possible to hook a graphical
monitor up to it.</p> 
<h2>VAXstation/microVAX jumper</h2>
<p>The MicroVAX 2000 and the VAXstation 2000 really are the same machine.
You can set a jumper on the system board to tell the system how to behave.</p>
<center><img src="vs2kjump.jpg" width="442" height="242" alt="VS2K jumper"></center>
<p>On the KA410 motherboard about two inches or so directly behind the thin ethernet
BNC connector:</p><ul>
<li>VAXstation 2000: jumper on pins closer to thin ethernet BNC</li>
<li>MicroVAX 2000: jumper on pins farther away from the thin ethernet BNC</li>
</ul>
<p>A blue jumper was used for the picture, so you could see it more easily
here, but the original jumper is black.</p>
<p>There are four serial ports on the cpu board.  On the MicroVAX 2000,
these become the console and three terminal ports.  On the
VAXstation 2000, these become the printer port, keyboard, mouse and modem
interface.</p>
<p>Both machines have a mono (1024x864x1) frame buffer on the
CPU board. You enable or disable it (read: change it from a
MicroVAX 2000 to a VAXstation 2000 and back) by inserting or removing
the jumper.</p>
<p>Also this jumper toggles a flag in the configuration register
(the "server flag") which is checked by 
some VAX/VMS software in order to decide which and how many licenses 
you need. This flag is used by NetBSD only to decide which string to
diplay, "MicroVAX 2000" or "VAXstation 2000"</p>
<h2>Console cable</h2>
<p>If the graphics board has been disabled with the jumper, the console is 
switched to the printer port. However, to get the console to appear on the
printer port, setting the jumper is not required. 
It is possible to force a VS2000 to use a serial console without fiddling
with the jumper on the motherboard.</p>
<p>The 2000 has four serial ports: the 25-pin comm port, the 9-pin printer port,
and two ports on the 15-pin video port for the mouse and keyboard. Normally,
to connect a printer to the 9-pin printer port you use a BCC05 cable. If you
use a BCC08 cable, the 2000 will use the 9-pin port as its console. The
BCC08 shorts pins 8 and 9 of the 9-pin port together to signal it should be
used as a console. The other interesting pins on the 9-pin port are:</p>
<pre>
	1 - Shield GND
	2 - Transmitted data
	3 - Received data
	7 - Signal GND
</pre>
<p>This is the console cable:</p>

                              8 - CTS                4 - RTS
                                                     5 - CTS

<p>Do not forget to short pins 8 and 9 on the VAX side, for some VS2000s this
is required to make the console work, regardless of the setting of the jumper.
<h2>Connectors on the system board</h2>

7 - ground      8 - ground      9 - fer_ena (jumper to pin 8 for console)

Video Connector (J5)

10 - vid_green  11 - vid_blue   12 - -12VDC
13 - mouse_xmit 14 - kbd_rcv    15 - kbd_xmit

The interesting pins in the video connector from a serial port perspective
are:

	6 - GND for keyboard
	14- Received data from keyboard
	15 - Transmitted data to keyboard

	7 - GND for mouse
	5 - Received data from mouse
	13 - Transmitted data to mouse

There is a plastic box about the size of a cigarette pack that plugs
into the db9 printer port and db15 keyboard/mouse/video cable
connector and screws into place outside the main chassis.  It takes
over that db9 and db15 and gives you three DECconnect (MMJ) connectors
for terminal ports for the MicroVAX 2000 configuration.
It is possible (if you have the connectors lying around) to build cables to
break out the serial ports without needing the DEC box. Just use the pinouts
described above.

<h2>Building a replacement cable</h2>
<p>With the pin numbering information above you should be able to build a
new cable. Problem is that there are less wires going to the disk connectors
than there are pins in the connectors, so while putting the cable in the
connector you are going to have to skip pins, as you can see in the pictures.

<p>This is where the wires should be on the hard disk connectors.

<p><center><img src="rd32jump.jpg" width="472" height="249" alt="RD32 jumpers"></center>
<p>This is where the jumper on the RD32 hard disk should be, jumpered as the third of four drives.</p>
<p>The floppy drive should be jumpered as ID0, the first drive.</p>
<h2>Formatting the hard disk</h2>
<p>It is very useful to have a VS2000 around, if only to format hard disks with.
For a MFM hard disk to work in a MicroVAX it must have a very peculiar format
written to it. The VS2000 and the Q-bus RQDX3 controller for the MicroVAX II et al
require this format to be present. The VS2000 is the only DEC device that can
write this format without expensive hard to get software: the formatter is
present in the VS2000 ROM under the TEST 70 command. If the formatting of a 
disk you are using on a RQDX controller is damaged, you can format the disk in 
a VS2000 and hook it back up to the RQDX controller, the disk will work like 
new. <a href="fmtbob.html">Click on this link</a> to read how to format a disk 
in the VS2000.</p>

<img src="fmt-02k.jpg" alt="fmt-02k.jpg" width="320" height="240"></center>
<p>This is how I format hard disks with my VS2000. I have brought the
existing cables to the outside of the box via the opening that is there
to connect the expansion unit to the computer. Just remove the plate and
you can pull the cables through it. Very easy!
