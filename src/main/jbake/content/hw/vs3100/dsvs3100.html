DESCRIPTION
 
The VAXstation 3100 is Digital's powerful, low-cost VAXstation for high-
performance graphics applications.  The VAXstation 3100 is a full member of the
standard-setting VAX family of computers that has sold over 200,000 systems
since the introduction of the VAX 11/780.  Based on the second generation of
VAX chipset technology, the VAXstation 3100 redefines low-end VAX computing by
delivering three times the performance of previous entry-level VAXstation
workstations.
 
The VAXstation 3100 provides an integrated computing environment that offers
you a unique combination of desktop VAX computing, industry-standard personal
productivity tools, and transparent access to distributed applications and
resources.  Through DECwindows, Digital's new windowing interface, the
VAXstation 3100 enables both sophisticated and novice users to access all the
power of the network through their desktop applications.  And the VAXstation
3100 workstation is easy to buy, easy to install, and easy to use.
 
Featuring a versatile packaging design, the VAXstation 3100 can be configured
as a diskless network node, a standalone workstation, or a system that can
simultaneously be a workstation and a server for up to seven other VAXstation
3100 workstations.  The VAXstation 3100 can be configured for a broad range of
needs, running applications that provide solutions from the factory floor to
the executive offices.
 
FEATURES
 
o Entry-level VAXstation maintains full VAX family compatibility while adding
  new power and features.  Over 6,000 software applications immediately
  available (VAX terminal applications, VWS/UIS, X Window System, and
  DECwindows) plus access to industry-standard MS-DOS applications.
o Compact, three-piece desktop package minimizes desktop footprint.  Innovative
  packaging delivers full configuration flexibility - from diskless workstations
  up to 1.2 gigabytes of storage.
o High-performance system design uses CMOS-based Central Processor/Floating
  Point and a two-level cache.  Features large, internal memory expansion
  (8-32 Mbytes), Ethernet connectivity, and high-performance I/O subsystem.
o Choice of 32-bit operating systems - VMS or ULTRIX.
o Supports the VWS/UIS or DECwindows user interface, allowing for a natural
  migration as the DECwindows application base expands.
o Introduces Desktop-VMS Software, a full function VMS operating system
  environment that greatly simplifies installation and system management of
  standalone and clustered VAXstation 3100 workstations.  Interactive question
  and answer dialogue through DECwindows makes system management and
  installation easy.
o Optional MS-DOS software coprocessor runs unmodified PC applications at IBM
  PC/AT speed.  Cut and paste from MS-DOS applications into DECwindows
  applications is easy.
o Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) allows external expansion of industry-
  available SCSI peripherals.
 
HIGH-PERFORMANCE DESKTOP SYSTEM
 
The VAXstation 3100 delivers 2.6 to 4.2 times the CPU performance of previous
entry-level VAXstations by offering the same CMOS central processing unit found
in Digital's MicroVAX 3500/3600 systems and VAXstation 3200/3500 workstations.
The minimum configuration contains 8 Mbytes of memory and is expandable to 32
Mbytes.  Each VAXstation 3100 system contains a single plane of 1024 x 864
video resolution, with an 8-plane graphics coprocessor available as an option.
Both 15-inch and 19-inch monochrome and color monitors are available.
 
The VAXstation 3100 offers you a choice of Digital's powerful 32-bit operating
systems: VMS or ULTRIX.  VMS is Digital's general-purpose, virtual-memory
operating system that runs on all VAX systems, from the desktop to the
datacenter.  ULTRIX is Digital's native-mode UNIX operating system as well as
the first POSIX-compliant operating system in the industry.  In both
environments, the common VAX architecture enables you to easily integrate the
VAXstation 3100 with Digital's other workstations, MicroVAX systems, larger VAX
systems, and VAXclusters.
 
The VAXstation 3100 environment is further enhanced by Desktop-VMS Software.
Based on DECwindows and compact disc drive technology, Desktop-VMS Software
brings a new level of simplicity to the previously complicated tasks of
installing and managing standalone workstations or connected groups of
workstations.  As distributed computing reaches into new areas of your
organization, you face new system management requirements.  Desktop-VMS
Software enables individuals with minimal system management experience to
effectively manage their own systems or workgroups, so more experienced systems
personnel can focus on higher-level system management tasks.
 
Multiple networking protocols are supported by both VMS and ULTRIX, so you can
choose between TCP/IP and DECnet/OSI.  You can create workgroups by using
either VAXcluster software (VMS) or NFS (ULTRIX).  Your ability to operate
between the environments is further enhanced by the VMS-ULTRIX Connection
product set, which adds NFS Server functions and TCP/IP to the VMS environment.
 
DECWINDOWS
 
With DECwindows running on your VAXstation 3100, you can enjoy the same
advanced user interface regardless of the underlying operating system.
Digital's DECwindows is a high-performance, network-transparent windowing
system.  It is a superset of the industry-standard X Window System Digital has
implemented for the ULTRIX, VMS, and MS-DOS operating systems.  Through
DECwindows you can view the output from any X application running on the
network, just as any X-compliant VAXstation 3100 application can be displayed
on other systems that conform to the X standard.
 
DECwindows uses Digital's X User Interface (XUI), ensuring a consistent look
and feel that is independent of hardware platform or operating system.
Standard applications delivered with DECwindows include mail and VT320
emulation (with ReGIS capability) as well as a number of other personal
productivity applications.  Digital also offers layered products (available
separately) for the DECwindows environment that support compound document
processing, graphics, and decision support.  Many popular third-party
applications are also available on the DECwindows platform.
 
Your investment in current VMS VAXstation applications is protected because the
VAXstation 3100 separately supports the VAX Workstation Software User Interface
System (VWS/UIS).   And investment protection continues with ULTRIX VAXstations
because current applications will run without modification.
 
MS-DOS COMPATIBILITY
 
The power and performance of the VAXstation 3100 are complemented by the wealth
of personal productivity applications available through VAXpc for VMS Software,
an MS-DOS software coprocessor under DECwindows.  VAXpc enables the VAXstation
3100 to emulate the instruction set of the Intel 80286 microprocessor.  As a
result, VAXpc windows on your workstation look and act exactly like they do on
a personal computer.  VAXpc gives you the ability to cut and paste from any
industry-standard PC application into the DECwindows environment.
 
VERSATILE CONFIGURATIONS
 
The VAXstation 3100 is available in two compact desktop packages - the Model 30
and the Model 40.  Each system offers equal computing power, memory expansion,
and display capabilities, but differs in the amount of internal storage
capacity.
 
The VAXstation 3100 Model 30 is a compact desktop system that can be configured
in three ways: (1) a complete starter system with disk and load/backup device;
(2) a satellite workstation either diskless or with paging/swapping disks; (3)
a network workstation with disks to permit use as a connected yet independent
system.  The Model 30 system unit supports either three 3.5-inch half-height
devices for a maximum of 208 Mbytes of internal disk storage and a 1.44-Mbyte
PS/2-compatible floppy or a combination of one 3.5-inch half-height device and
one 5.25-inch half-height device for a maximum of 104 Mbytes of internal disk
storage with a TZ30 95-Mbyte streaming tape.
 
The Model 40 features a slightly larger system enclosure (approximately two
inches taller) and can accommodate three 3.5-inch half-height disks and two
5.25-inch half-height load devices.  This results in a 312-Mbyte system that
has both a TZ30 95-Mbyte streaming tape and an RRD40 Compact Disc Drive
(providing 600 Mbytes of storage capacity) internal to the system box.  This
package, configured with 16 Mbytes of memory and dual SCSI channels enables the
Model 40 to become a &quot;Serverstation&quot;, functioning as a server for up to seven
other diskless VAXstation 3100 workstations.  At the same time, the
Serverstation is also a fully-functional workstation for an individual user.
The Serverstation capability greatly reduces the entry-level cost of the
VAXstation 3100 Model 40 for a small workgroup.  A special version of the
VAXserver 3400 is available for larger workgroups.
 
The Model 30 and Model 40 packages allow for external storage and load
expansion such as 332-Mbyte full-height hard disks, 600-Mbyte compact disc
drives, and TK50 95-Mbyte streaming tapes via the SCSI port.  Both the Model 30
and Model 40 will use this external port to enable future expansion using a
variety of third-party peripherals.
