<P>There are eight LED's divided into two felds of four on the back of the 
system box. These LED's provide feedback during each phase of power-up 
initialization and testing. The first four indicate the state of the system 
while the second four indicate substate and are dependent on the indication 
given from the state LED's.

    <TD>1011</TD>
    <TD>0000</TD>
    <TD>The DZ test completes. An optional video has been found but its

      code.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1011</TD>
    <TD>0001</TD>
    <TD>The DZ test completes. No optional video is installed or, if it is 
      installed, fails self-test. In either case, the base monochrome video test 
      has been entered.</TD></TR>
  <TR>

    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The system initializes and power-up testing starts. The substate 
      variable indicates the subsystem test being excuted. See subsystem table 
      below.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>1000</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The self-test completes with the substate indicating the failing 
      subsystem. See subsystem table below. Enter TEST 50 to see results.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0111</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>Self-test was entered from the console TEST command. The substate 
      indicats the subsystem test currently being executed. See subsystem table 
      below. Enter TEST 50 to see results.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0110</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The self-test completes from the TEST command with the substate 
      indicating the failing subsystem. See subsystem table below. Enter TEST 50 
      to see results.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0101</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The self-test started under control of the APT system. The substate 
      indicats the subsystem test currently being executed. See subsystem table 
      below. Enter TEST 50 to see results.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0100</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The system exerciser started from a console TEST command. The substate 
      indicats the value of the lower four bits of the command. If the system 
      exerciser starts with a T 101, the substate contains a 0x0001. Read the 
      test results on the screen. </TD></TR>

    <TD>The system exerciser started under control of the APT test delivery 
      system. Read the test results on the screen.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0010</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>The entity-based module received a request from a host to enter 
      monitor mode. This lets the host send commands to the system. This is 
      indicated if the functionality of the EBM is implemented at a later 
      release of the system ROM. Reserved for future use.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0001</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>Console mode was successfully entered and is ready to accept commands. 
      This does not apply to power on. The substate indicates the failing 
      subsystem if there is one. This differs from a self-test complete, because 
      the console can be entered by means other than TEST command or power-on 
      halt (for example HALT button). </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>0000</TD>
    <TD>XXXX</TD>
    <TD>Attempting to boot the system. Once control passes to VMB, the state 
      LED's have no meaning.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
