~~~~~~
<p>The Emulex UC07 Q-bus SCSI controller is supported by NetBSD.
It talks MSCP to the VAX, so that's no problem.
The UC07 can be configured to use either disks or tapes, but _not_
at the same time. (the UC08 has 2 SCSI controllers for that purpose..)</p>

<p>The UC07/8 
adapters do their own low-level format of the disk and map geometries and
stuff, and you have to go into its firmware to confgure a new disk with 
it. its not a very complicated process, the UC07 actually has a simple 
little menu system in firmware that makes it pretty easy. It will take
a while if you have a large disk though! 
Even if you remove a disk, the UC07 still reports it present (but offline) 
to any software. </p>

<h2>Setup program</h2>
<p>To access the on-board diag/setup program you enter these commands
at the chevron prompt:</p>

<p>XXXX and YYYY are offsets depending on the address of the controller.</p>

<p>Please forgive me if there are any typo's.</p>

<p>I have an UC07 in my 3600 and it works great. I just had a 
small problem with an IBM DORS SCSI drive. It would be detected
OK and I could set it up with the diagnostics, but the VAX wouldn't
boot from it. It seemed like some initialisation problem of the UC07 
and the IBM drive. I swapped it with a HP drive and this works fine.</p>

<h2>Jumper settings</h2>

SW3 and/or 4:

SW1/2
1	off- run 	on- reset/halt
2	off- enable  	on- disable
3 	reserved
4	off-normal 	on-loop self test

SW3/4
5	off-TMSCP 	on-MSCP
6	(mscp only) 	off-disable autoboot on-enable autoboot

interrupt request level (default is 4 and the manual highly recommends it)
quad wide uco7/8        4       5
scsi bus 1 - jumper PR	in	out
                    RS	out	in

bus 2-		    LM 
		    MN same as above

on a dual-wide UC07, same story, but they're jumpers TU and UV


on a microVAX, heres how to start the firmware for disks. 

first, a handy table

csr	XXXX	YYYY
72150	1468	146a
72154	146c	146e
60334	00dc	00de
60340	00e0	00e2
60344	00e4	00e6

and so on down to
60420	0110	0112


now at the chevron, enter
i
d/p/w 20001f40 20
d/p/l 20088000 80000000
d/p/l 20088004 80000001
d/p/w 2000XXXX 1
d/p/w 2000YYYY 3003
d/p/w 2000YYYY 4401
pause a second
then
s 80
If that fails, wait a second or two, then try s 80 again.
The firmware is menu driven and conversational, very easy to use. 
If anyone still wants a xerox of the manual after this info, let me know.
