<p>Setting up an Emulex QD33 SMD controller and formatting the drives
is done via an on-board setup program. Go to the chevron prompt
and issue these commands:
<pre>
u
i
d/p/w 20001f40 20
d/p/w 20088000 80000001                   
d/p/w 20088004 80000002
d/w   20001468 1
e/w   20001468 ( should be 0900 or b00 )
d/w   2000146a 3003
e/w   2000146a ( 100 )
d/w   2000146a 4401
s  80  for a VSII, s 82
</pre>
<p>This assumes the controller is at its standard address 772150.
After the S80 the menu of the on board program will appear.
<p>Follow the menu. Be warned, that you must use units 0 and 1 on
the drives, and the entries are ordered in the eeprom that way.
IE, first setup is for unit 0, second is for unit 1.
