<h1>KDA50 switch settings</h1>
<p>From my KDA50 user manual:

<p>Hold the M7164 board with the LEDs & ribbon cable connectors upwards
and the Qbus edge connectors down.  The block of 10 dip switches sets
the bus address.

<p>The left-most switch is S1 (and corresponds to address bit 11) and the 
right-most is S10 (and corresponds to address bit 2).

<p>To set the address to 172150, the switches should be (from left to
right):
<pre>
   A11 A10  A9  A8  A7  A6  A5  A4  A3  A2
    S1  S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9 S10

   off  on off off off  on  on off  on off
</pre>
